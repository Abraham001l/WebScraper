Baltimore Ravens are going to go as far as Derrick Henry and Lamar Jackson can carry them. And if Saturday night’s dominant win over the Pittsburgh Steelers is any indication, that could take them all the way to New Orleans.

it’s been the run, defense, special teams. But Lamar’s added a little flavor to that whole thing and we’re throwing the ball well too.
A defensive holding penalty on the Steelers gave the Ravens a free first down with a little more than three minutes to go. One play later, a sweep to Henry nearly picked up another as the running back powered for eight yards and only just was stopped from taking it to the house. Instead, the Ravens just picked up one more crucial third down on a direct snap to tight end Mark Andrews and were able to take a knee to ice it. If the Ravens continue to block and run the way they did on Saturday night, it’s hard to find a defense in the NFL that’s going to be able to stop them. There was little back-patting in the locker room after the game as the Ravens looked forward to Sunday’s slate of games and figuring out whether they’ll play at home or on the road next week, but to Jackson it doesn’t matter.

The Steelers held the Ravens to their first three-and-out of the game on the next drive and suddenly Pittsburgh looked back in business.
But the Ravens defense stiffened at the right time, sacking Wilson with defensive tackle Nnamdi Madubuike delivering a crunching sack on a third-down play to force a punt as the third quarter came to an end.
